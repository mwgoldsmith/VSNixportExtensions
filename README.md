Visual Studio "Nixport" Extensions
==================================

A collection of several MSBuild Build Customizations and Project Templates for Visual Studio created to simplify the process of porting *nix open source libraries to a native Windows build system. More specifically, the intent is to achieve user friendly, easily maintainable, scalable functionality akin to `make install` while using MSbuild to build VC++ projects.
